          <h1 class="major">Centre for Fiscal Democracy: Our approach</h1>
          <p>Here is a <i>very</i> brief summary of the philosophy and approach we've evolved and hope to stick to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>prefer to do what is already known by experience to work; be blunt about getting things right, and acting strategically, rather than innovating</li>
            <li>be gradual, tenacious, sustainable, long-term, concrete, practical, consistent and realistic</li>
            <li>only accept funding that won't deflect us from our strategy; be happy to leave money on the table</li>
            <li>prefer open source, open data, self-hostable software, agreed protocols and interfaces, standards</li>
            <li>form long-term relationships with civil society actors to scrutinise and engage with each state entity monitored</li>
            <li>if individuals want only part of what we provide, don't make it unreasonably hard for them not to take the whole; they may combine our work with their own; accept that others get credit for changes we enable</li>
          </ul>
